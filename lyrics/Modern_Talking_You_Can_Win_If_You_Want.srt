6
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,160
You packed your things in a carpetbag

7
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,700
Left home - never looking back

8
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,050
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes

9
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,520
Music wherever you go

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,370
You don't fit in a smalltown world

11
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,350
But I feel you're the girl for me

12
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,640
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,190
You're leaving town where nobody knows

14
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,860
You can win if you want

15
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,980
If you want it, you will win

16
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,400
On your way you will see that life is more than fantasy

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,700
Take my hand, follow me

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,850
Oh, you got a brand-new friend for your life

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,530
You can win if you want

20
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,700
If you want it you will win

21
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,950
Oh Come on

22
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,310
Take your chance for a brand-new wild romance.

23
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,670
Take my hand for the night and your feelings will be right

24
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,540
Hold me tight.

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,430
Oh darkness finds you're on your own

31
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,820
Endless highways keep on rollin' on.

32
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,230
You are miles and miles from your home

33
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,340
But you never want to phone your home.

34
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,640
A steady job and a nice young man

35
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,110
Your parents had your future planned.

36
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,290
Rings on her fingers

37
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,410
Paint on your toes

38
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,890
That's the way your story goes.

39
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,640
You can win if you want

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,810
